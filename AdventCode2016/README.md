# Advent2016

Advent of code 2016

## Introduction

This repository was done a long time after 2016. The first time I heard of Advent of Code was 2017 when I worked at SÃ¶derberg & Partners. The next year, 2018, some of us tried the challenge again both S&P and Knowit people. 

## Tech used

I will be using Visual Studio Code and .NET core ver 3.0.
