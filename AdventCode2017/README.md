S&amp;P Advent Code 2017 Challenge

## Installation
This solution is using C# on Visual Studio 2017.
The tests for day 2 expect the data files to be in C:\work and not where they are stored in the repo.
The tests that fail (Day 2: 4) contain the solutions to the 4 daily problems.

## Summary

After all this time I finally got my act together and fixed the last bugs and puzzles!
This one was all my own solutions.
